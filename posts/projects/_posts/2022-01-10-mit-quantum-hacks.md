2nd place finish at the 2022 MIT Interdisiplinary Quantum Hackathon, out of at least 60 teams.

In a team with two other computer science and physics students at my school, we created a simulator for a quantum key distribution algorithm, which we called [Keytanglement](https://github.com/JRice15/keytanglement). The admittedly silly name reveals the two components undergirding our project:
* Quantum Entanglement, the strange property of quantum particles that makes it so two particles be deterministically related even when seperated by a great distance.
* Encryption Keys, which can be utilized as a [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) to achieve unbreakable encryption (in theory).

I'm not super knowledgable in quantum physics; I was mostly there for my general skill in Python. My main task ended up being coding up and integrating the frontend with all of the backend quantum circuits code that my partners cooked up.

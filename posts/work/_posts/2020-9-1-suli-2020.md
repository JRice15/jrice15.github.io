Researching physics-informed machine learning approaches to sea-surface temperature, utilizing Koopman operator theory and autoencoders. Lead author on resulting research paper.

For the summer of 2020, I participated in the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) at Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL). My project was to explore deep-learning techniques for long-term sea-surface temperature (SST) forecasting.

In the [resulting manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00399), coauthored with my internship mentors, we explore various autoencoder architectures inspired by Koopman Operator Theory. We find that for this particular problem, the architecture that made the least assumptions about the internal state of the autoencoder's latent space provided the best results.
